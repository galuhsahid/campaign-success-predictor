# Campaign Success Predictor Dashboard

Paper: [Estimating the collected funding amount of the social project campaigns in a crowdfunding platform](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/8355046/)

## Notes
One of the sources of data is Facebook. Therefore you need to get your access token, which you can get from [here](https://developers.facebook.com/tools/explorer/) and set it as your environment variable:

```export FB_ACCESS_TOKEN=[your access token]```

. However, when I built this model I was using v2.9 of the Facebook Graph API and the API structure might have changed a little bit.
